	"horsetamingguide-text": "<strong>A Guide to Horse Taming:\n-----by Verlia</strong>\n\nTaming horses follows a very similar path to taming elks. You'll need to capture a foal to get started! Either bring it home, or build an enclosure around them to get started.\nAfter the foal has eaten enough portions, it will grow into a semi-tamed adult. From here, you'll have to saddlebreak it!\nBuilding a tall wall around the horse is a good idea now, because while saddlebreaking they'll jump around and run all over! Typically, you'll have to saddlebreak them about 15 times, give or take a few (it's random), at least once a day until the process is complete.\nOnce you've reached that final day and complete your last saddlebreak, the horse will convert into a fully tamed horse! At this point, you can equip it with more things, like saddlebags, a medallion, and cooking pots for your adventures! (More attachments WIP).",
